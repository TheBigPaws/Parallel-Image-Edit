-SETUP:-

1.Start by extracting the downloaded github file.
2a. To simply run the application, go inside Exe_file and run Parallel_img_edit.exe
2b. To view the code, open the solution file in the Source Code file. This application has been written using Visual Studio framework.

This application was made as a final project for 2nd year Parallel Computing course at Abertay University. 
It is an image editing library, that takes advantage of both GPU and CPU parallelization.

It is at a presentable state, however, I do wish to revisit this project to fix all the little bugs I didn't have time for initially.

This application also lets you use your own pictures, as well as save the edited result. 

-TO EDIT YOUR OWN PICTURE:-

Simply paste a BMP picture into the Pictures folder. 

-LEGAL:-

This Application is free source and has in no way been used to make profit.

All libraries and Images have been used for educational purposes.
